# Cost Sharing UI Design

This directory contains example HTML pages that demonstrate the user interface design for the Cost Sharing application. These examples use static data and no JavaScript - they are intended to show the visual structure and layout of the application:

- **Single Page Application**: All views are shown/hidden using JavaScript state management
- **Tabbed Interface**: Group details use tabs to organize Members, Expenses, and Balances
- **Modal Forms**: Expense creation, group creation, and member addition use modal overlays
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes

## Example HTML

* [Login](examples/login.html) - The initial view shown to unauthenticated users
* [Groups List](examples/groups-list.html) - Page to view and manage groups 
* [Create Group](examples/create-group.html) - Modal overlay to create a new group
* [Group Details](examples/group-details.html) - Page to view details of a group and manage membership
* [Add Member](examples/add-member.html) - Modal overlay to add a member to a group
* [Expenses](examples/expenses.html) - Page to manage expenses of a group
* [Create Expense](examples/create-expense.html) - Modal overlay to create a new expense
* [Edit Expense](examples/edit-expense.html) - Modal overlay to edit an existing expense
* [Balances](examples/balances.html) - Page to show a summary of expenses and reconciliation


## Example CSS

The CSS file [`css/style.css`](css/style.css) contains all styles needed for the application.
